About Me
======
I am a graduate student at Cornell University, Cornell Tech, pursuing a Master of Science degree in Information Systems.

Prior to Cornell, I earned my Bachelor of Management (2019-2023) with Highest Honors at [Beijing Foreign Studies University](http://en.bfsu.edu.cn), majoring in Information Systems and Information Management. During my undergraduate studies, I did research under [Prof. Xiaoyu Ma](https://ibs.bfsu.edu.cn/en/teacher.aspx?m=20150306133438693116&t_id=20151216145951253431) and [Prof. Zhou He](http://agentlab.cn/en/cv/index.html).

## Research Interests - Supply Chains
My current interest focuses on enhancing firms' supply chain resilience (i.e., the supply chainâ€™s adaptive capability). I aspire to apply machine learning, optimization, and simulation to supply chain management (e.g., optimize process efficiency, centralize production monitoring, and generate just-in-time insights). In particular, I believe that by simulating supply chain networks and developing machine learning algorithms to optimize for resilience and efficiency, firms can better position themselves to respond to disruptive events and accommodate customer demands.

I have several working papers which employ structural equation modeling and agent-based modeling to explore factors (e.g., the reconfigurability of networks) affecting supply chain resilience, therefore deriving tactics to alleviate the damage and build resilience. For professional experience, I interned at the [Solution and Service Group](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/about/our-businesses/solutions-services-group/) of Lenovo, developing MARS (chipset inventory forecasting system), SMT Optimization system (subsystem for PCBA manufacturing planning) and Advanced Planning System (production scheduling system). Currently, I am developing a system to forecast passenger check-in time for [Beijing Daxing International Airport Terminal](https://daxing-pkx-airport.com/guide/terminals/) to facilitate capacity management.

Beyond supply chain, I also have experience in innovation management, machine learning, and comprehensive evaluation. My academic work in innovation management has been published in [Technological Forecasting and Social Change (10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122736)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122736). It uses machine learning methods to construct a novel index system and evaluate national innovation performance.
