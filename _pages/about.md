About Me
======

Welcome! I am a coding enthusiast aspiring to apply machine learning and optimization to supply chain management (e.g. optimize process efficiency, centralize production monitoring and generate just-in-time insights). In particular, I am interested in enhancing firm's supply chain resilience (ie. supply chain's adaptive capability to respond to disruptions).

I earned my Bachelor of Management in Information Systems and Information Management from [Beijing Foreign Studies University](http://en.bfsu.edu.cn). My academic work in innovation management is forthcoming in [Technological Forecasting and Social Change](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/technological-forecasting-and-social-change). It uses machine learning method to construct a novel index system and evaluate country's innovation level. I also have several working papers in supply chain management, which employ structural equation modeling (SEM) and agent-based modeling (ABM) to explore supply chain mechanisms related to resilience (e.g. the bullwhip effect). These research aim to analyze supply chain disruptions, thus deriving tactics to alleviate the damage and build resilience. For professional experience, I interned at the [Solution and Service Group](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/about/our-businesses/solutions-services-group/) of Lenovo for 3 month, developing MARS (chipset inventory forecasting system), SMT Optimization system (PCBA manufacturing planning) and Advanced Planning System. Currently, I am developing a system to forecast passenger check-in time for [Beijing Daxing International Airport Terminal](https://daxing-pkx-airport.com/guide/terminals/).
