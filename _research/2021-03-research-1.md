 This research examines the relationship between firm resilience and industrial-internet based on a resource-based view. We identified three mediating factors in the above relationship, including visibility, collaboration and agility. In addition, we utilize internal self-control as a moderating factor. Through the Alliance of Industrial Internet, we collected 622 valid survey responses from Chinese manufacturing companies. The result suggests that higher level of industrial-internet capabilities leads to higher visibility, collaboration and agility, thus enhancing firm resilience. Internal self-control moderates the above relationships.
