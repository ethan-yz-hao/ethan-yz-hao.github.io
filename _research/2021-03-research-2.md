 This research intends to contribute on the methods for identifying supply chain risk and investigate factors that effect supply chain resilience. We employ agent-based modeling and simulation method to model the behavior of firms under supply chain disruptions and use the industrial Internet supply as an example to identify its high-risk nodes. Then, by testing different parameters' effects on the resilience measures and analyzing the results using Taguchi method, we study the factors affecting supply chain resilience.
