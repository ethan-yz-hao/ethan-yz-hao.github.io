 The research intends to explore supply chain mechanisms that effect its resilience. We employ an agent-based model of a generic push-type manufacturing supply chain. 
 
push-type supply chains with heterogenous agents characterized by capital endowment.
 
 We employ
an Agent Based Model of a generic food chain network consisting of stylized individuals representing
producers, traders, and consumers. We do this: 1/ to describe the dynamically
changing disaggregated flows of crop items between these agents, and 2/ to be able to
explicitly consider agent behaviour. The agents have implicit personal objectives for trading.
We quantify resilience and efficiency by linking these to the fraction of fulfilment of the overall
explicit objective to have all consumers meet their food requirement. We consider different
types of network structures in combination with different agent interaction types under
different types of stylized shocks. We find that generally the network structures with higher
efficiency are also more sensitive to shocks, while less efficient network types display more
resilience. At first glance these results seem to confirm the existence of a system-level
trade-off between resilience and efficiency similar to what is reported in business management
and ecology literature. However, the results are modified by the trading interactions
and the type of shock. In our simulations resilience and efficiency are affected by ‘soft’
boundaries caused by the preference and trust of agents (i.e., social aspects) in trading.
The ability of agents to switch between trading partners represents an important aspect of
resilience, namely a capacity to reorganize. These insights may be relevant when considering
the reorganization of real-life food chains to increase their resilience to meet future food
and nutrition security goals.
