 To acquire a primary understanding of how technology facilitates economic issues, under the guidance of my advisor, Prof. Xiaoyu, and other scholars, I joined the research team of Global Intelligence Innovation Index and Voucher or Cash–Empirical Study Based on International Samples. I successfully developed a Machine-Learning method to analyze socioeconomic issues. It utilized K-means and Random Forest models to yield the Mean Decrease of Impurity and analyze feature importance in regression analysis. In addition, I participated in data collection, imputation, and visualization, as well as writing the article, which is now seeking publication. Through this experience, I mastered essential coding skills, extended my experience in Machine Learning, and was motivated to pursue further.
