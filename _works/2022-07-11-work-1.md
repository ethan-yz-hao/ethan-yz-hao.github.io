## MARS

 Assisted in the development of MARS (multi-period, multi-priority forecasting system for chipset inventory), which used multi-objective linear programming models with GLPK solver in Cvxpy module to calculate chipsets shortages. Performed code review and system testing. Wrote project document. 

## Surface Mount Technology Optimization System 

 (planning system for PCBA assembly). Constructed multi-objective mixed-integer programming models using GLPK solver in the Cvxpy module to optimize the number of PCB panels produced. Coded the demo (Cvxpy, GLPK). Presented solutions.

## Smart Advanced Planning System

 (planning system for production scheduling). Modeled the problem into a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model, similar to the vehicle routing problem and parallel machine scheduling problem. Implemented genetic algorithm using Geatpy module.

## Knowledge Share on Python

 Maintained documents on the Confluence platform. Wrote knowledge-share documents and hosted a knowledge-share event about Python.
