## MARS

 Assisted in the development of MARS (a forecasting system for chipset inventory), which used linear programming models with GLPK solver in Cvxpy module to calculate chipsets shortages. Performed code review and system testing. Wrote project document.

 **MARS Core Solver**
 multi-period
 multi-priority
 multi-objective

## Surface Mount Technology Optimization System 

 Developed preliminary solution for Surface Mount Technology (SMT) Optimization System (a planning system for PCBA assembly). Constructed multi-objective mixed-integer programming models using GLPK solver in the Cvxpy module to optimize the number of PCB panels produced. Coded the demo (Cvxpy, GLPK). Presented solutions.

## Smart Advanced Planning System

 Developed preliminary solution for Smart Advanced Planning System (APS) (a planning system for production scheduling). Modeled the problem into a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model, similar to the vehicle routing problem and parallel machine scheduling problem. Implemented genetic algorithm using Geatpy module.

## Knowledge Share on Python

 Maintained documents on the Confluence platform. Wrote knowledge-share documents and hosted a knowledge-share event about Python.
